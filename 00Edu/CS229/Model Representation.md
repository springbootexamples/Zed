# Model Representation

To establish notation for future use, we’ll use 

to denote the 
[[input variables]] 
> $\begin{aligned}
x^{(i)}x(i)
\end{aligned}$ 


(living area in this example), also called input features, and 

to denote the 
[[output variable]] 
> $$y^{(i)}y(i)$$
that we are trying to predict (price). 

A pair 
> $$(x^{(i)} , y^{(i)} )(x(i),y(i))$$ is called a [[training example]], and the dataset that we’ll be using to learn—a list of m training examples

> $${(x^{(i)} , y^{(i)} ); i = 1, . . . , m}$$

> $$(x(i),y(i));i\=1,...,m$$—is called a [[training set]]. Note that the superscript “(i)” in the notation is simply an index into the training set, and has nothing to do with exponentiation. We will also use X to denote the space of input values, and Y to denote the space of output values. In this example, X = Y = ℝ.

To describe the supervised learning problem slightly more formally, our goal is, given a training set, to learn a function h : X → Y so that h(x) is a “good” predictor for the corresponding value of y. For historical reasons, this function h is called a hypothesis. Seen pictorially, the process is therefore like this:

When the target variable that we’re trying to predict is continuous, such as in our housing example, we call the learning problem a 
>[[regression problem]]. 

When y can take on only a small number of discrete values (such as if, given the living area, we wanted to predict if a dwelling is a house or an apartment, say), we call it a 
>[[classification problem]].
